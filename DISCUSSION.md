# Work log: Sam Hill's take-home assignment

[Knocked out low-hanging UI fruit](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/1)

Made sure the barebones functionality works first.

[Added loading and error states](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/2)

I plan to work on the backend a bit after this, so I wanted to ensure that it was easy to see what was going on from the frontend - waiting for calls to complete or errors to happen.

[Added pagination and real search](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/3)

[Cleaned up the UI's look](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/4)

## Ideas for Future Work

* Improved Search Filtering to search by location, degree, or specialties, in addition to the search term
* Pagination UI Enhancements - enhance the pagination UI, add page numbers
* Sorting: by first name, city, or years of experience
* User Authentication: allow users to save searches
* Infinite scrolling instead of buttons - just a better UI
