# Work log: Sam Hill's take-home assignment

[Knocked out low-hanging UI fruit](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/1)

Made sure the barebones functionality works first.

[Added loading and error states](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/2)

I plan to work on the backend a bit after this, so I wanted to ensure that it was easy to see what was going on from the frontend - waiting for calls to complete or errors to happen.

[Added pagination and real search](https://github.com/samjhill/solace/pull/3)
